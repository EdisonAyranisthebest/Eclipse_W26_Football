    "# The 4th Down Equation: Analyzing the Interaction Between Offensive EPA and Defensive Pass-Prevention Tendencies\n",

    "## Research Question\n",
    "\n",
    "How does going for it on 4th down affect Expected Points Added (EPA) on the play, and does this effect differ based on a defense’s pass-prevention tendencies, measured by opponents’ average depth of target (aDOT) allowed and EPA allowed on deep passing plays?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Outcomes:**\n",
    "- Quantifying the \"Go for it\" Impact: We aim to demonstrate that going for it on 4th down generally results in a positive Expected Points Added (EPA) compared to more conservative play-calling, particularly in short-yardage situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Defensive Shell Sensitivity: We hope to discover if offensive success on 4th down is significantly hindered by defenses with low average depth of target (aDOT) allowed—which suggests a \"bend-but-don't-break\" or deep-pass-prevention style.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The \"Deep-Pass EPA\" Correlation: We want to test the hypothesis that teams facing a defense with a high Deep-Pass EPA allowed will see a higher marginal benefit (EPA gain) when going for it on 4th down passing plays.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Interaction Effects: We aim to demonstrate that the decision to go for it is not \"one size fits all\" but is statistically dependent on defensive tendencies, showing that an offense's EPA outcome on 4th down varies predictably when interacting with a defense's historical pass-prevention metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data-Driven Decision Making: Ultimately, we hope to provide a framework that moves beyond \"offensive confidence\" to show that specific pbp-derived defensive metrics (like aDOT and deep-pass EPA) should be primary factors in a team’s 4th-down strategy.\n",

    "**Description:** \n",
    "A comprehensive dataset containing play-by-play information for every NFL game. It includes advanced metrics like Expected Points Added (EPA), Win Probability (WP), and specific play details such as air yards, pass location, and personnel.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Number of observations: Approximately 45,000 to 50,000 plays per regular season. For your specific study on 4th downs, this will be filtered down to roughly 4,000–5,000 observations depending on the years selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Number of features: 370+ variables per play, covering everything from game state (time, score, yard line) to advanced efficiency metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- epa: Expected Points Added on the play (Target Variable).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- fourth_down_attempt: Binary indicator (1 if the team went for it, 0 otherwise).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- air_yards: Distance the ball traveled in the air, used to calculate aDOT.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- pass_length / pass_location: Used to identify deep passing plays.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- defteam: The defensive team, used to aggregate defensive tendency metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- yardline_100: Distance to the opponent's end zone.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Time period covered: The nflverse repository contains data from 1999 to the 2024 season. Based on your project guidance, you will likely focus on the most recent 2024–2025 data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data collection method: Scraped and cleaned play-by-play data sourced directly from the NFL’s Game Statistics and Information System (GSIS).\n",
